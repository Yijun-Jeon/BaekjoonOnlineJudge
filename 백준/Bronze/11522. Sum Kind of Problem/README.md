### 문제 설명

For this problem you will compute various running sums of values for positive integers.

### 입력 

<div id="problem_input" class="problem-text">
	<p>The first line of input contains a single integer P, (1 ≤ P ≤ 10000), which is the number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed identically and independently.</p>

	<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It contains the data set number, K, followed by an integer N, (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000).</p>
</div>

### 출력 

<div id="problem_output" class="problem-text">
	<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single output line consists of the data set number, K, followed by a single space followed by three space separated integers S1, S2 and S3 such that:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>S1 = The sum of the first N positive integers.</li>
		<li>S2 = The sum of the first N odd integers.</li>
		<li>S3 = The sum of the first N even integers.</li>
	</ul>

</div>
